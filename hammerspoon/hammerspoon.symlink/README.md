## A bit about this Hammerspoon config

As with all things you find in someone's dotfiles repo; it is largely customized
to that user's needs.

This one is no different, so be sure you understand what it's doing before just
using it all willy-nilly.

#### What you can (soon) expect from this config

- window management
  - manual window manipulation (via hotkey bindings)
  - automatic window manipulation based upon:
    - set layouts
    - application specific needs
    - hostname (I regularly swap between my desktop and laptop for work)
- application launching/toggling hotkeys (was using alfred for this)
- intra-application hotkeys (you could easily achieve this with bettertouchtool,
    or osx' native application/global hotkey bindings). E.g., map F12 to launch
    Chrome Dev tools
- f.lux-like screen temp changing based upon sunset/sunrise, location, etc
- audio, wifi, usb event watching
- .. and so much more
