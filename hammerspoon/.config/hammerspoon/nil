# David Baldwin review with Woon

### technically seems there

- could figure out persistence
- choose agents, but not quite sure, he chose that and kinda went through that
- personality-wise, really good, was nice; initially a little reserved
- conversation was pretty good despite lack of current pairing experience
- got a sense that was indeed used to working solo; though shown he was really passionate about being on a team

* perhaps we SHOULD limit to an hour
* we are able to gauge problem-solving skills with our current exercise with pairing
* was able to express and show that he can reason about a problem and implement a solution
* seems like our exercise is sufficient to show a person's problem solving abilities
* with the pairing, we are able to see how they interact/personality
* only thing missing; the difficulty doesn't allow us to differentiate between a person's skills..
  + it doesn't really allow us to see how _senior_ they are.
* there are folks that don't care about the language, but more about the domain; so not necessarily stack focused, but more about willing to learn and do what it takes to reach a business goal.
* Woon's thought was that Sebastian is a senior in SWE, but not in elixir
