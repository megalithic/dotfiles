# spinner

# Display a spinner for long running commands
# (this script leaves no trail of the spinner at finishing)

# Usage:
# spinner [long-running-command]

# tl;dr
# `stdout` will be whatever the output of your command is and
# `stderr` will be the spinner spinning around round oud und nd d
# So you can pipe stuff without problem ;)

# Execute your stuffs in a background job
eval "${@:-sleep 1}" &

# Point fd#3 to fd#1 (Save it for later use), then point fd#1 to fd#2
# PD: This does not interfere with the variable for the PID i.e. $!
exec 3>&1 >&2
