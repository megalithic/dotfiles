{"id":".dotfiles-wvu","title":"Fix app context modal keybindings (disabled due to bugs)","description":"# App Context Modal Keybindings - DISABLED\n\nModal keybindings for app contexts (Slack, Teams, etc.) are currently disabled due to unresolved bugs.\n\n## Symptoms Observed\n- Keybindings work initially then stop working after some time\n- Some keys work intermittently (Ctrl+J works, Ctrl+K doesn't)\n- Performance issues / lag reported\n- Behavior inconsistent across sessions\n\n## Root Cause Investigation\n\n### Initial Hypothesis (Partially Correct)\nThe `titleChanged` event was triggering `start()` repeatedly, which was adding duplicate keybindings via `obj.modal:bind()`. This caused binding accumulation and modal state corruption.\n\n### Fix Attempted\n1. Added `_bindingsCreated` guard flag to Slack context to prevent duplicate bindings\n2. Removed redundant `modal:enter()`/`modal:exit()` calls from individual contexts (Slack, Teams)\n3. Centralized modal lifecycle management in `contexts/init.lua` orchestrator\n\n### Result\nFix was incomplete - bindings still failed. The guard prevented accumulation but didn't resolve the underlying issue.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n```\nEvent Flow:\n  App Event (activated/deactivated/titleChanged/etc.)\n      ↓\n  watchers/app.lua → runContextForAppBundleID()\n      ↓\n  contexts/init.lua → M:run()\n      ↓\n  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n  │ isActivationEvent(event)?           │\n  │   → modal:enter() (if not active)   │\n  │   → context:start() or onActivate() │\n  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n  │ isDeactivationEvent(event)?         │\n  │   → modal:exit() (if active)        │\n  │   → context:stop() or onDeactivate()│\n  └─────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Key Files\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `contexts/init.lua` | Orchestrator - modal enter/exit, event routing |\n| `contexts/com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap.lua` | Slack keybindings (Ctrl+J/K/N/P etc.) |\n| `contexts/com.microsoft.teams2.lua` | Teams context (minimal) |\n| `watchers/app.lua` | App watcher that triggers context runs |\n\n### Event Lists (contexts/init.lua)\n```lua\n-- Activation events (lines 12-17)\nactivationEvents = {\n  hs.application.watcher.activated,\n  hs.application.watcher.launched,\n  hs.uielement.watcher.windowCreated,\n  hs.uielement.watcher.titleChanged,  -- ← Fires frequently in Slack\n  hs.uielement.watcher.applicationActivated,\n}\n\n-- Deactivation events (lines 20-26)\ndeactivationEvents = {\n  hs.application.watcher.terminated,\n  hs.application.watcher.deactivated,\n  hs.uielement.watcher.elementDestroyed,\n  hs.uielement.watcher.titleChanged,  -- ← Also here! (but if/elseif prevents both)\n  hs.uielement.watcher.applicationDeactivated,\n}\n```\n\n## Current State\n- `M.MODALS_ENABLED = false` in contexts/init.lua (line 10)\n- `M.DEBUG = false` (set to true for investigation)\n- Debug logging infrastructure in place\n- Individual context files have debug wrappers (can be removed later)\n\n## To Re-enable and Debug\n1. Set `M.DEBUG = true` in contexts/init.lua\n2. Set `M.MODALS_ENABLED = true` in contexts/init.lua\n3. Reload Hammerspoon\n4. Open Hammerspoon Console (Cmd+Shift+C)\n5. Switch to Slack, use it for a few minutes\n6. Watch for patterns in console output:\n   - `[CTX DEBUG] MODAL EXITED` without switching apps = BUG\n   - `[SLACK KEY]` logs without action = binding issue\n   - No key logs at all = modal not active\n\n## Potential Causes to Investigate\n1. **titleChanged frequency**: Slack changes title constantly (typing indicators, unreads). Even with guards, this triggers context code repeatedly.\n2. **Modal state desync**: `_modalActive` flag may get out of sync with actual modal state\n3. **hs.hotkey.modal quirks**: Hammerspoon's modal system may have edge cases with rapid enter/exit\n4. **Event ordering**: Activation and deactivation events may arrive in unexpected order\n5. **Memory/performance**: Repeated event processing may cause issues\n\n## Related Commits\n- Initial fix attempt: `fix(hs): prevent modal binding accumulation in Slack context`\n- Disabled: `fix(hs): disable app context modals and Spotify interactions`","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-12T13:00:35.70971-05:00","created_by":"seth","updated_at":"2026-01-12T13:49:15.475224-05:00"}

Good Observer API but synchronous-only. Used by Swindler and Hammerspoon2.\n2. **Swindler** (tmandry, 732 stars) - Window management with in-memory state cache. Key insight: caches all window states so reads are instant.\n3. **Hammerspoon2** (cmsj, 45 stars) - Swift rewrite using AXSwift internally. Confirms our architecture approach is sound.\n4. **AXorcist** (steipete, 133 stars) - Modern query-based AX automation. Elegant declarative element finding pattern worth adopting later.\n\n### Key Insights\n- None of these libraries handle JXA/AppleScript - our Process+osascript approach is correct\n- Swindler's in-memory caching pattern could help with rapid captures\n- AXorcist's declarative query pattern (`findElement(matching: [.role(.button), .title(\"Back\")])`) is cleaner than tree walking\n- Our AccessibilityHelper is comparable to AXSwift's core functionality\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-08T10:48:19.138249-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-08T12:16:54.611701-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-08T12:16:54.611701-05:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

{"id":"shade-s7p","title":"Shift key combinations not passed to terminal/PTY","description":"## Bug Description\n\nShift key combinations fail in Shade's embedded terminal:\n- Cannot type `:` (Shift+;) to enter nvim command mode\n- Cannot type `O` (Shift+o) for new line above\n- All shifted characters appear to fail (?, \", {, etc.)\n\n## Works correctly in:\n- Regular nvim in Ghostty\n- Regular nvim in Kitty\n- Previously worked when Shade used Kitty as the terminal backend\n\n## Likely Cause\n\nShade's key event handling is not properly passing the Shift modifier to the PTY/terminal emulator. The issue is likely in how NSEvent key events are translated and written to the PTY.\n\n## Investigation Areas\n\n1. **Key event handling** - Check how `keyDown` events are processed\n   - Look for NSEvent handling in view controllers or custom views\n   - Check if `event.modifierFlags` includes `.shift` and if it's being used\n\n2. **Character translation** - The shifted character should come from `event.characters`, not manual shift handling\n   - `event.characters` = the actual typed character (already shift-aware)\n   - `event.charactersIgnoringModifiers` = the base key\n\n3. **PTY write path** - Verify the correct characters are being written to the PTY fd\n   - Add debug logging to see what bytes are actually sent\n\n4. **SwiftTerm or terminal emulator** - If using a library, check its key handling\n\n## Files to Investigate\n\n- Any `*ViewController.swift` or `*View.swift` with `keyDown` overrides\n- Terminal/PTY setup code\n- Any custom `NSTextInputClient` implementations\n\n## Test Case\n\n1. Launch Shade\n2. Open nvim (or just a shell)\n3. Try typing `:` - should fail (types `;` instead or nothing)\n4. Try typing `O` - should fail (types `o` instead or nothing)\n5.
