--# selene: allow(unused_variable)

-- Contains two low latency audio recognizers for different mouth noises, which can be used to trigger actions like scrolling or clicking.
-- The recognizers are also high accuracy and don't use much CPU time.
--
-- This module was written by [Tristan Hume](http://thume.ca/). If you have any issues with or questions about the recognition, email him.
-- All first person references in this module's documentation refer to him.
--
-- The detectors are tuned so that they work for most people and most microphones. For best results use a highly directional headset microphone so that it doesn't pick up other people and background
-- noises around you, and put the boom off to the side of your mouth so you aren't directly breathing on it.
--
-- The two mouth noises (and their corresponding event numbers) are:
--
-- ### "sssssssssss"
-- The "sssss" noise/syllable is easy to make and can be made continuously. The detector emits an event `1` when you start saying "sss" and a `2` after you stop.
-- It's good to hook up to variable-length actions like clicking/dragging and scrolling. It can detect very quiet noises so even just barely saying "ssss" under your
-- breath should trigger it without annoying anybody else around you too much. It works with most "sss" syllables but I find sharper is better, in crispness that is, loudness doesn't matter much.
-- It has a very low false negative rate, but often has false positives. It will obviously trigger in english speech since "s" is a common syllable, but with some microphones breathing in certain ways
-- will trigger it as well. Personally I use this to scroll down, it allows me to read long articles and books lying down with my laptop without awkward hand positioning to scroll with the trackpad.
--
-- ### Lip Popping
-- Popping your lips is harder to do reliably and can't be done for variable lengths of time. The detector calls your callback with the number `3` when it detects one.
-- This detector has an almost zero false positive rate in my experience and a very low false negative rate (when you manage to make the sound).
-- Personally I use this to scroll up by a large increment in case I scroll down too far with "sss", and when my RSS reader is focused it moves to the next article.
-- The only false positives I've ever had with this detector are various rare throat clearing noises that make a pop sound very much like a lip pop.
---@class hs.noises
local M = {}
hs.noises = M

-- Creates a new listener for mouth noise recognition
--
-- Parameters:
--  * A function that is called when a mouth noise is recognized. It should accept a single parameter which will be a number representing the event type (see module docs).
--
-- Returns:
--  * An `hs.noises` object
function M.new(fn) end

-- Starts listening to the microphone and passing the audio to the recognizer.
--
-- Parameters:
--  * None
--
-- Returns:
--  * The `hs.noises` object
---@return hs.noises
function M:start() end

-- Stops the listener from recording and analyzing microphone input.
--
-- Parameters:
--  * None
--
-- Returns:
--  * The `hs.noises` object
---@return hs.noises
function M:stop() end
