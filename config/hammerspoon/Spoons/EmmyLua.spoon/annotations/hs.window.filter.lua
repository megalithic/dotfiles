-- Filter windows by application, title, location on screen and more, and easily subscribe to events on these windows
--
-- Warning: this module is still somewhat experimental.
-- Should you encounter any issues, please feel free to report them on https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/issues
-- or #hammerspoon on irc.libera.chat.
--
-- Windowfilters monitor all windows as they're created, closed, moved etc., and select some (or none) among these windows
-- according to specific filtering rules. These filtering rules are app-specific, i.e. they start off by selecting all windows
-- belonging to a certain application (but you can also define *default* and *override* filters - see `:setAppFilter()`,
-- `:setDefaultFilter()`, `:setOverrideFilter()`) and they can allow or reject windows based on:
--   * visibility, focused and/or fullscreen status
--   * title length or patterns in the title
--   * position on screen (inside or outside a certain region or screen)
--   * accessibility role (standard window, dialog, etc.)
--   * whether they're in the current Mission Control Space or not
--
-- The filtering happens automatically in the background; windowfilters then:
--   * generate a dynamic list of the windows that currently satisfy the filtering rules (see `:getWindows()`)
--   * sanitize and expose all pertinent events on these windows (see `:subscribe()` and the module constants with all the events)
--
-- A *default windowfilter* (not to be confused with the default filter *within* a windowfilter) is provided as convenience;
-- it excludes some known apps and windows that are transient in nature, therefore unlikely to be "interesting" for e.g. window management.
-- `hs.window.filter.new()` (with no arguments) returns a copy of the default windowfilter that you can further tailor
-- to your needs - see `hs.window.filter.default` and `hs.window.filter.new()` for more information.
--
-- Usage examples:
-- ```
-- local wf=hs.window.filter
--
-- -- alter the default windowfilter
-- wf.default:setAppFilter('My IDE',{allowTitles=1}) -- ignore no-title windows (e.g. transient autocomplete suggestions) in My IDE
--
-- -- set the exact scope of what you're interested in - see hs.window.filter:setAppFilter()
-- wf_terminal = wf.new{'Terminal','iTerm2'} -- all visible terminal windows
-- wf_timewaster = wf.new(false):setAppFilter('Safari',{allowTitles='reddit'}) -- any Safari windows with "reddit" anywhere in the title
-- wf_leftscreen = wf.new{override={visible=true,fullscreen=false,allowScreens='-1,0',currentSpace=true}}
-- -- all visible and non-fullscreen windows that are on the screen to the left of the primary screen in the current Space
-- wf_editors_righthalf = wf.new{'TextEdit','Sublime Text','BBEdit'}:setRegions(hs.screen.primaryScreen():fromUnitRect'0.5,0/1,1')
-- -- text editor windows that are on the right half of the primary screen
-- wf_bigwindows = wf.new(function(w)return w:frame().area>3000000 end) -- only very large windows
-- wf_notif = wf.new{['Notification Center']={allowRoles='AXNotificationCenterAlert'}} -- notification center alerts
--
-- -- subscribe to events
-- wf_terminal:subscribe(wf.windowFocused,some_fn) -- run a function whenever a terminal window is focused
-- wf_timewaster:subscribe(wf.hasWindow,startAnnoyingMe):subscribe(wf.hasNoWindows,stopAnnoyingMe) -- fight procrastination :)
-- ```
---@class hs.window.filter
local M = {}

-- Sets the windowfilter to allow all visible windows belonging to a specific app
--
-- Parameters:
--  * appname - app name as per `hs.application:name()`
--
-- Returns:
--  * the `hs.window.filter` object for method chaining
--
-- Notes:
--  * this is just a convenience wrapper for `windowfilter:setAppFilter(appname,{visible=true})`
---@return hs.window.filter

-- A table for window roles (as per `hs.window:subrole()`) that are allowed by default.
--
-- Set the desired window roles as *keys* in this table, like this: `hs.window.filter.allowedWindowRoles = {AXStandardWindow=true,AXDialog=true}`
--
-- Notes:
--  * You can have fine grained control of allowed window roles via the `setAppFilter`, `setDefaultFilter`, `setOverrideFilter` methods.
--  * If you know what you're doing you can override the allowed window roles globally by changing this variable, but this is discouraged.
M.allowedWindowRoles = nil

-- Returns a copy of an hs.window.filter object that you can further restrict or expand
--
-- Parameters:
--  * windowfilter - an `hs.window.filter` object to copy
--  * logname - (optional) name of the `hs.logger` instance for the new windowfilter; if omitted, the class logger will be used
--  * loglevel - (optional) log level for the `hs.logger` instance for the new windowfilter
--
-- Returns:
--  * An `hs.window.filter` object
---@return hs.window.filter

-- The default windowfilter; it filters apps whose windows are transient in nature so that you're unlikely (and often
-- unable) to do anything with them, such as launchers, menulets, preference pane apps, screensavers, etc. It also
-- filters nonstandard and invisible windows.
--
-- Notes:
--  * While you can customize the default windowfilter, it's usually advisable to make your customizations on a local copy via `mywf=hs.window.filter.new()`;
--    the default windowfilter can potentially be used in several Hammerspoon modules and changing it might have unintended consequences.
--    Common customizations:
--    * to exclude fullscreen windows: `nofs_wf=hs.window.filter.new():setOverrideFilter{fullscreen=false}`
--    * to include invisible windows: `inv_wf=windowfilter.new():setDefaultFilter{}`
--  * If you still want to alter the default windowfilter:
--    * you should probably apply your customizations at the top of your `init.lua`, or at any rate before instantiating any other windowfilter; this
--      way copies created via `hs.window.filter.new(nil,...)` will inherit your modifications
--    * to list the known exclusions: `hs.inspect(hs.window.filter.default:getFilters())` from the console
--    * to add an exclusion: `hs.window.filter.default:rejectApp'Cool New Launcher'`
--    * to add an app-specific rule: `hs.window.filter.default:setAppFilter('My IDE',1)`; ignore tooltips/code completion (empty title) in My IDE
--    * to remove an exclusion (e.g. if you want to have access to Spotlight windows): `hs.window.filter.default:allowApp'Spotlight'`;
--      for specialized uses you can make a specific windowfilter with `myfilter=hs.window.filter.new'Spotlight'`

-- Tells all windowfilters whether to refresh all windows when the user switches to a different Mission Control Space.
--
-- Due to OS X limitations Hammerspoon cannot directly query for windows in Spaces other than the current one;
-- therefore when a windowfilter is initially instantiated, it doesn't know about many of these windows.
--
-- If this variable is set to `true`, windowfilters will re-query applications for all their windows whenever a Space change
-- by the user is detected, therefore any existing windows in that Space that were not yet being tracked will become known at that point;
-- if `false` (the default) this won't happen, but the windowfilters will *eventually* learn about these windows
-- anyway, as soon as they're interacted with.
--
-- If you need your windowfilters to become aware of windows across all Spaces as soon as possible, you can set this to `true`,
-- but you'll incur a modest performance penalty on every Space change. If possible, use the `hs.window.filter.switchedToSpace()`
-- callback instead.
--
-- Notes:
--  * If you defined one or more Spaces-aware windowfilters (i.e. when the `currentSpace` field of a filter is present), windows need refreshing at every space change anyway, so this variable is ignored

-- Gets the current windows allowed by this windowfilter
--
-- Parameters:

-- Notes:
--  * As the name implies, even the empty, "allow all" windowfilter will ignore these apps.

--    * if a table, you can fully define a windowfilter without having to call any methods after construction; the

--    * otherwise it must be a function that accepts an `hs.window` object and returns `true` if the window is allowed

-- Sets the detailed filtering rules for the windows of a specific app
--
-- Parameters:
--  * appname - app name as per `hs.application:name()`
--  * filter - if `false`, reject the app; if `true`, `nil`, or omitted, allow all visible windows (in any Space) for the app; otherwise it must be a table describing the filtering rules for the app, via the following fields:
--    * visible - if `true`, only allow visible windows (in any Space); if `false`, reject visible windows; if omitted, this rule is ignored
--    * currentSpace - if `true`, only allow windows in the current Mission Control Space (minimized and hidden windows are included, as they're considered to belong to all Spaces); if `false`, reject windows in the current Space (including all minimized and hidden windows); if omitted, this rule is ignored
--    * fullscreen - if `true`, only allow fullscreen windows; if `false`, reject fullscreen windows; if omitted, this rule is ignored

--    * focused - if `true`, only allow a window while focused; if `false`, reject the focused window; if omitted, this rule is ignored
--    * activeApplication - only allow any of this app's windows while it is (if `true`) or it's not (if `false`) the active application; if omitted, this rule is ignored
--    * allowTitles
--      * if a number, only allow windows whose title is at least as many characters long; e.g. pass `1` to filter windows with an empty title
--      * if a string or table of strings, only allow windows whose title matches (one of) the pattern(s) as per `string.match`
--      * if omitted, this rule is ignored

--    * allowRegions - an `hs.geometry` rect or constructor argument, or a list of them, designating (a) screen "region(s)" in absolute coordinates: only allow windows that "cover" at least 50% of (one of) the region(s), and/or windows that have at least 50% of their surface inside (one of) the region(s); if omitted, this rule is ignored
--    * rejectRegions - an `hs.geometry` rect or constructor argument, or a list of them, designating (a) screen "region(s)" in absolute coordinates: reject windows that "cover" at least 50% of (one of) the region(s), and/or windows that have at least 50% of their surface inside (one of) the region(s); if omitted, this rule is ignored

--      * if omitted, use the default allowed roles (defined in `hs.window.filter.allowedWindowRoles`)
--
-- Returns:
--  * the `hs.window.filter` object for method chaining
--
-- Notes:
--  * Passing `focused=true` in `filter` will (naturally) result in the windowfilter ever allowing 1 window at most
--  * If you want to allow *all* windows for an app, including invisible ones, pass an empty table for `filter`
--  * Spaces-aware windowfilters might experience a (sometimes significant) delay after every Space switch, since (due to OS X limitations) they must re-query for the list of all windows in the current Space every time.

--  * event - string or list of strings, the event(s) to subscribe to (see the `hs.window.filter` constants); alternatively, this can be a map `{event1=fn1,event2=fn2,...}`: fnN will be subscribed to eventN, and the parameter `fn` will be ignored
--  * fn - function or list of functions, the callback(s) to add for the event(s); each will be passed 3 parameters
--    * a `hs.window` object referring to the event's window
--    * a string containing the application name (`window:application():name()`) for convenience
--    * a string containing the event that caused the callback, i.e. (one of) the event(s) you subscribed to
--  * immediate - (optional) if `true`, also call all the callbacks immediately for windows that satisfy the event(s) criteria
--
-- Returns:
--  * the `hs.window.filter` object for method chaining
--
-- Notes:
--  * Passing lists means that *all* the `fn`s will be called when *any* of the `event`s fires, so it's *not* a shortcut for subscribing distinct callbacks to distinct events; use a map or chained `:subscribe` calls for that.
--  * Use caution with `immediate`: if for example you're subscribing to `hs.window.filter.windowUnfocused`, `fn`(s) will be called for *all* the windows except the currently focused one.
--  * If the windowfilter was paused with `hs.window.filter:pause()`, calling this will resume it.
---@return hs.window.filter
function M:subscribe(event, fn, immediate, ...) end

-- Callback to inform all windowfilters that the user initiated a switch to a (numbered) Mission Control Space.
--
-- Parameters:
--  * space - the Space number the user is switching to
--
-- Returns:
-- * None
--
-- Notes:
--  * Only use this function if "Displays have separate Spaces" and "Automatically rearrange Spaces" are OFF in System Preferences>Mission Control
--  * Calling this function will set `hs.window.filter.forceRefreshOnSpaceChange` to `false`
--  * If you defined one or more Spaces-aware windowfilters (i.e. when the `currentSpace` field of a filter is present), windows need refreshing at every space change anyway, so using this callback will not result in improved performance
--  * See `hs.window.filter.forceRefreshOnSpaceChange` for an overview of Spaces limitations in Hammerspoon. If you often (or always) change Space via the "numbered" Mission Control keyboard shortcuts (by default, `ctrl-1` etc.), you can call this function from your `init.lua` when intercepting these shortcuts; for example:
--  ```
--  hs.hotkey.bind('ctrl','1',nil,function()hs.window.filter.switchedToSpace(1)end)
--  hs.hotkey.bind('ctrl','2',nil,function()hs.window.filter.switchedToSpace(2)end)
--  -- etc.
--  ```
-- * Using this callback results in slightly better performance than setting `forceRefreshOnSpaceChange` to `true`, since already visited Spaces are remembered and no refreshing is necessary when switching back to those.
function M.switchedToSpace(space, ...) end

-- Removes one or more event subscriptions
--
-- Parameters:
--  * event - string or list of strings, the event(s) to unsubscribe; if omitted, `fn`(s) will be unsubscribed from all events;
--    alternatively, this can be a map `{event1=fn1,event2=fn2,...}`: fnN will be unsubscribed from eventN, and the parameter `fn` will be ignored
--  * fn - function or list of functions, the callback(s) to remove; if omitted, all callbacks will be unsubscribed from `event`(s)
--
-- Returns:
--  * the `hs.window.filter` object for method chaining
--
-- Notes:
--  * You must pass at least one of `event` or `fn`
--  * If calling this on the default (or any other shared use) windowfilter, do not pass events, as that would remove
--    *all* the callbacks for the events including ones subscribed elsewhere that you might not be aware of. You should
--    instead keep references to your functions and pass in those.
---@return hs.window.filter
function M:unsubscribe(event, fn, ...) end

-- Removes all event subscriptions
--
-- Parameters:
--  * None
--
-- Returns:
--  * the `hs.window.filter` object for method chaining
--
-- Notes:
--  * You should not use this on the default windowfilter or other shared-use windowfilters
